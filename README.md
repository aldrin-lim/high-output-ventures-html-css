Task 1: HTML/CSS
Convert the following design mockup to static HTML/CSS. The output should be as close possible to the original design.

You can use a CSS framework of your choice as a starting point or write your own CSS

The design is provided as a Figma link, you can sign up for a free account to access individual properties for each component

We'll look into:

• How close it follows the design mockup (attention to detail)

• The quality of your code (is it semantic, well-organized etc.)
